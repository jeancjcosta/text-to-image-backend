### Text to image using diffusers

## Install the code requirements
    - Install python 3.10 (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
    - Go to the project's root and run:
    - Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and get the comand to install 
    torch and torchvision for your cuda version. So run:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Sample input/output after your training.
    - The input is a text describing a image, such as "a child screaming at finding 
    a worm within a half-eaten apple".
    - To test it in the backend server you have to do run the app.py and make a GET request to
    {base_url}/text-to-image with text parameter containing the image description.
    - After a request a generated image will be stored in the folder /generated_images and the 
    endpoint will return a base64 string representing the image. You can also try it by a swagger ui
    available in {base_url}/docs or directly by the frontend page.
    - The output is an image generated by the model.

### Note: To run the backend server you have to run the app.py file in the root of the project.
